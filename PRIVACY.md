# Privacy Policy

**Last updated:** 2026-01-05

## Overview

FocusCraft is a local-first productivity timer Chrome extension. It is designed to work entirely on the user’s device and does **not** collect, transmit, or sell personal data.

## Data Collection

FocusCraft **does not collect, store, or transmit**:

* Personal information
* Browsing history
* Website content
* Login credentials
* Analytics or tracking identifiers

## Local Storage

FocusCraft uses Chrome local storage **only on the user’s device** to save:

* Timer settings (study and break durations, custom values)
* User preferences (auto-start, sound on/off)
* Temporary alert state

This data never leaves the user’s browser.

## Permissions Explained

FocusCraft requests the following permissions:

* **notifications** – to display a system notification when a focus or break session ends
* **storage** – to save user preferences locally
* **alarms** – to run the timer reliably even when the popup is closed

These permissions are used strictly for core functionality.

## Third Parties

FocusCraft does **not** use third-party services, analytics, ads, trackers, or external APIs.

## Changes

If this privacy policy changes, the updated version will be published on GitHub and the Chrome Web Store.

## Contact

For questions or issues, please contact the developer via GitHub.
